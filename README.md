# Solar 3D Printer

The puspose is to create a 3D printer fully powered by sun. 

No solar panels converting solar energy to electricity will be involved except for powering the electronics.

The extruder will be heated directly from sun with the help of a Fresnel lens. The extruder will have a fixed position in order to be easily heated by a mirror.

Motors will be Stirling motors powered by sun (with Fresnel lens also).

The printer bead with move in 3 directions: X, Y and Z.
